    "#Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that lies at the heart of simplifying complex systems. It's essentially the art of focusing on the \"what\" instead of the \"how.\" Imagine it as building a black box that does something specific, without worrying about the intricate machinery inside.\n",

Abstract classes define the overall structure and behavior of a class, but leave some methods unimplemented (abstract methods).

Interfaces, on the other hand, focus solely on behavior and don't contain any implementation. Classes can implement multiple interfaces, promoting flexibility and reusability.\n",
